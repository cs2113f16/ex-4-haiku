Rather than beep 
Or a rude error message: 
These words: "File Not Found". 

Errors have occurred. 
We won't tell you where or why - 
Lazy programmers! 

Chaos reigns within. 
Reflect, repent, and reboot 
Order will return. 

For a new PC, 
Center of my universe, 
I abandon all. 

The code was willing! 
It considered your request, 
But the chips were weak. 

Everything is gone. 
Your life's work has been destroyed. 
Squeeze trigger? (yes/no) 

A file that big? 
It might be very useful. 
But now it is gone. 

No keyboard present 
Hit F1 to continue 
Zen engineering? 

Website has been moved 
We'd tell you where, but then we'd 
Have to delete you. 

The web site you seek 
Cannot be located but 
Countless more exist. 

Aborted effort: 
Close all that you have worked on. 
You ask way too much. 

Windows XP crashed. 
I am the blue screen of death. 
No one hears your screams. 

Yesterday it worked. 
Today it is not working. 
Windows is like that. 

Printer not ready. 
Could be a fatal error. 
Have a pen handy? 

With searching comes loss 
And the presence of absence: 
"My novel" not found. 

The Tao that is seen 
Is not the true Tao, until 
You bring fresh toner. 

Stay the patient course. 
Of little worth is your ire. 
The network is down. 

A crash reduces 
Your expensive computer 
To a simple stone. 

Three things are certain: 
Death, taxes, and lost data. 
Guess which has occurred. 

Seeing my great fault 
Through darkening blue windows 
I begin again. 

You step in the stream, 
But the water has moved on. 
This page is not here. 

Out of memory. 
We wish to hold the whole sky, 
But we never will. 

10,000 Things 
How long do any persist? 
Explorer is gone. 

Server: poor response 
Not quick enough for browser 
Time out, plum blossom. 

Having been erased, 
The document you're seeking 
Must now be retyped. 

Serious error. 
All shortcuts have disappeared. 
Screen. Mind. Both are blank.

Saw a bum today
Sunning himself in the grass
As I parked my car

Oh, my leg is hurt
Animals don't need health care
A lion eats me

in the wilderness
no one is being coddled
there is no health care

More office antics
...Weddings are a bleak affair
Now that is funny

if you lose your leg 
then use the bone for a cane
do not be wasteful

I think to myself
Would an idiot do that
If so, then I don't

a dead animal
is stuck in the wall up here
they won't get it out

they won't remove it
"more important things to do"
that is their excuse

decomposing things
smell so very terrible
it's nauseating

white or blue collar
it doesn't matter to me
'cause i'm collar-blind

taco bell sounds good 
alas, i can't go today
fridays are hectic

Lunch at taco bell?
If you want to meet us there
If not, that's okay

you are correct, sir
wonder who's responsible
for that press release?

have you given thought
to seeing a phantoms game
at the downtown rink?

i am quite lucky
i'm not near any windows
i won't get squirted

rubber band army
has invaded my work space
you must be real bored

this day has gone fast
i'm doing next to nothing
thursday will be fun

My tires are new
Again the same old rattle
That damn dealership!

10 items or less
finally started to watch
not to terrible

i am so thirsty
75 cents for pop
a grave injustice

haiku collection
out on those there interwebs
that is freakin sweet!

i find it obscene
to wake up before the sun
"spring forward" my arse

kinda exhausted
daylight savings time, not cool
I want to sleep more

a crapload of snow
makes me drive 2 mph
pissing off others

Still lives with his mom
This guy is Optimus Prime
More then meets the eye

My tires are new
Again the same old rattle
That damn dealership!

old crusty donuts
are sometimes left abandoned
in the lunch room - yum!

elephants were here!
i'd like a pet elephant
elephants kick ass!

New Moon approaches
A time for new beginnings
Flushing out old stones

I passed kidney stone
There was a terrible sound
I'm all better now

story of my life
never here for the good stuff
always missing out

i found 20 bucks
at the bottom of my purse
i do happy dance!

my feet are frozen
trudging through mountain of snow
it not very nice

Pete saw his shadow
now, six more weeks of winter
I'm sick of the cold

Fear the hat right now
it keeps pete warm and cozy
we need to buy some

The other white meat
Delicious and so tasty
am I eating "babe"?

Dogs swim in the sea
Fish make love, children are sick 
and you drink water?

meat's dirty and cruel
milk is pumped full of hormones
don't eat anything!

I need a new job
People say I do nothing
Web guy now depressed

Office Calendar
Everybody likes pizza
Great Equalizer

my new assistant
he works on what I tell him
he does a good job

fireworks are pretty
go high and make booming noise
some are only duds

i miss mario
stripes streched over big belly
huffing and puffing

old confuscious say:
laughter is best medicine
ha ha he he ho!

pardon me, dear sir
what a strange predicament
now i fall on face
